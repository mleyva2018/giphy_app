# giphy_app
This is a node.js based app that displays a random gif on the topic of the user's choice. 

To use the app you must add your Giphy API key into the .env file.

A lot of work needs to be done to make it work properly, but it is a good start. You may also find that there is a database module for node, my plan is to add a db with some information, at some point.
